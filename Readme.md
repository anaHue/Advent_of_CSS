# Advent_of_Css

This is a challenge we setted up with a friend of mine. We asked Chat GPT to give us 24 ideas of frontend items to add to our website.
The goal of this repository is first to share different designs we made or learned to do. Secondly, we wanted to put our creativity in a project
and to discuss of our solutions.
